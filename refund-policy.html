        <h3 class="mt-4">1. Consulting Services</h3>
        <p>At Global Travelserve LLC, we provide professional SEO and Travel Logistics consulting. Because our services are based on labor, expertise, and time-intensive analysis, <strong>consulting fees are generally non-refundable</strong> once the work (audit, strategy session, or research) has commenced.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">2. Travel Booking & Deposits</h3>
        <p>Deposits for travel itineraries are subject to the terms of the specific airline, hotel, or third-party provider. Global Travelserve LLC acts as a consultant; therefore, any refunds for actual travel bookings are governed by the underlying service provider's policy.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">3. Cancellation Notice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancellations made 72 hours prior to a scheduled consulting session: 100% credit toward future services.</li>
            <li>Cancellations made less than 24 hours prior: Subject to a 50% "Late Cancellation" fee.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">4. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>We aim for 100% satisfaction. If you are unhappy with a consulting deliverable, please contact support@globaltravelserve.world within 7 days. We will work to rectify the strategy at no additional cost.</p>
