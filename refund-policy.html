<body>
    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>This policy is critical for merchant approval as it clearly defines when and how refunds are issued for our services.</strong></p>
    <h2>Travel Consulting Service (Flat Fee):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consulting Fee Refund:</strong> The planning fee is **non-refundable** once the Step 1 Discovery Call (service delivery initiation) has been completed and research has begun.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation Before Start:</strong> A full refund of the planning fee is available if the client cancels within [e.g., 24 hours] of payment and *before* the Discovery Call takes place.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SEO & Digital Marketing Service (Monthly Retainer):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retainer Refund:</strong> Monthly fees are generally **non-refundable** once the month's work (deliverables) has commenced.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Retainer services require [e.g., 30-days] written notice for cancellation. The client is responsible for payment for the full cancellation period.</li>
    </ul>
